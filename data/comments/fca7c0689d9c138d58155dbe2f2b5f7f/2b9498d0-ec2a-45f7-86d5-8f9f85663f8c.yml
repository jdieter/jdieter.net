  The problem is magnified with deltaisos, since each contains a large number of
  deltarpms, every one of which must rebuild properly. And one can make useful
  disos between ISOs which are far apart - for example, in Fedora, a diso from
  (N-1) Final to N Final is typically around half the size of the full ISO. But
  this makes it much more likely that a compression change will happen over this
  period - Final releases happen twice a year, so if a compression change
  happens once every 2 years, about 1/4 of these disos are potentially unusable,
  which means they are probably too unreliable at this point to catch on. Which
  is a shame, since someone who now downloads the full DVD every release could
  potentially cut this download in half.
