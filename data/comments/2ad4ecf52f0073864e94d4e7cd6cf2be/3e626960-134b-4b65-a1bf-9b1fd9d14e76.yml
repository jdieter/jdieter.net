message: "You might want to be a bit clearer in your phrasing here- bsdiff (the tool percieval implemented) already does \"overlayed add\"s too.  Not a great name for it, but about the best I could come up for the encoded command when I was adding bsdiff format support to diffball.\r\n\r\nTook a couple of read throughs of this blog before I figured out you weren't calling bsdiff, the tool, naive, you were referring to the raw algorithm rather then the actual bsdiff tool."
