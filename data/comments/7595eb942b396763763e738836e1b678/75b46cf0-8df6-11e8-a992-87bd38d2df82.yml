  That's not correct.  NFS 'async' means that the client sends the request to
  the server, and then the server acknowledges the request before it's actually
  hit the disk.  LizardFS has an option, PERFORM_FSYNC, on the chunkservers,
  that when disabled (as it was during the test), has the same effect. 
  GlusterFS also has a similar option, performance.flush-behind, on by default.
