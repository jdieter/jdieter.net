message: "Without having heard the talk, and only going by what you say here, I'd like to offer some quick thoughts:\r\n\r\nThere are (probably) always going to be hardware vendors who feel there is some kind of (false) security in keeping their binary firmware closed.  For those vendors, you have two choices:\r\n\r\n    1. Have it embedded in the hardware, always available for software drivers to load into memory\r\n    2. Offer it as (quasi-)distributable blobs that only some software vendors feel comfortable (or are legally able) to distribute\r\n\r\nWhen you have 1, you still may need to deal with the occasional workaround because the closed firmware can't be fixed; but with 2, you have the additional issue of not always being allowed to distribute that necessary firmware (I think of Broadcom, and the [minor, but annoying] crap I have to do when installing Fedora for the first time).\r\n\r\nSo in summary, the ideal is for hardware vendors to recognize the stupidity of using closed firmware blobs.  But when given the choice between 1 and 2, I personally can see where 2 would be preferred."
