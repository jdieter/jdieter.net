However, to further defend the man (just for fun):\r\n\r\nWhat if Intel were to revoke the license to distribute that firmware (if even possible)?  If embedded in the hardware itself, that couldn't ever be an issue.\r\n\r\nBut yeah, just throwing in my two cents and pocket full o' sunshine :-).  I appreciate this blog post either way, as it's stuff like this that gets me thinking."
