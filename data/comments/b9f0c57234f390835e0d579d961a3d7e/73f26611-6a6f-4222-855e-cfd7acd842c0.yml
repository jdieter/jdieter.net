message: "Nim, first off I want to say that I would be the first to agree that open source firmware beats the heck out of proprietary.\r\n\r\nMy main issue is with saying \"burned in ROM is good, inserted on bootup is bad\".  To me either both are good or both are bad.\r\n\r\nYou do have an excellent point about the lack of \"features\" in a burned-in firmware, but I would argue that it's a two edged sword.  Sometimes those \"features\" actually *are* features (Sony's Linux removal \"update\" is obviously excluded)."
