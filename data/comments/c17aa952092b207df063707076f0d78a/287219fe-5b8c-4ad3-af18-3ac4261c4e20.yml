message: "Um, do you have a particular person in mind?  If giving someone the N900 meant that Fedora would get onto smartphones sooner, I'd send it to them in a heartbeat, but I suspect most developers prefer reasonably new hardware that's fully working.\r\n\r\nAgain, if you can connect me to a developer that would actually use a partially-broken N900, I'll happily send it to them."
