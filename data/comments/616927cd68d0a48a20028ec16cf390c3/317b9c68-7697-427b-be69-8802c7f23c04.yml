  I'll check it out when we're down in Tyre again for a visit (should be within
  the next week or so).  However, given that TCP window scaling is enabled on
  Macs and the Macs were having no problems connecting, I'm not convinced this
  is the problem.  I will try shutting it off, though, and see what happens. 
  Thanks for the pointer.
