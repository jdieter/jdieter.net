  We've used btrfs on our servers in the past, mainly because we wanted to be
  able to use snapshots as archives.  We switched to ZFS because btrfs just
  wasn't fast enough, but this was a couple of years ago.


  Right now, we're using btrfs on the workstations and it's rocketing.  Our boot
  time has been reduced by somewhere around 50%.  One thing to remember, though,
  is that our workstations can be easily reimaged if there is a problem, so it's
  not like the data is in any way critical.
