  It's all mainly organizational.  Our koji instance forces me to follow certain
  procedures when building and releasing rpms that make it easier for me to see
  what I did in previous releases and reuse most of it.  Our Fedora 8 -&gt;
  Fedora 10 upgrade was especially difficult because I didn't do a good job of
  keeping my packages organized.


  If you look at <a href="http://koji.lesbg.com/lesbg/18/x86_64/RPMS/"
  rel="nofollow">http://koji.lesbg.com/lesbg/18/x86_64/RPMS</a>, you'll see a
  mix of rpms, some dating all the way back to Fedora 13.  Koji takes care of
  the inheritance so I don't have to worry about whether or not I've got the
  latest build, and supports multiple releases, so I can start putting together
  our Fedora 18 build while still pushing critical fixes to Fedora 17.


  And, finally, koji takes care of repo management, giving me a repository of
  only the latest packages, making it easy to see what we're actually using.  I
  can then easily retire obsolete packages in newer repositories while keeping
  them in the old repositories.
