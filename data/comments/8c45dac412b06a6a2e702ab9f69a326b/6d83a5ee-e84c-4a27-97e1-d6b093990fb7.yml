  I use Asterisk for the phone system at a private school.  It's primarily hard
  phones right now, but I'm working on getting the teachers to use SIP on their
  cell phones because the cell phone coverage is terrible there.  I noticed that
  pjsip was available now, I'll have to look into converting to it.
