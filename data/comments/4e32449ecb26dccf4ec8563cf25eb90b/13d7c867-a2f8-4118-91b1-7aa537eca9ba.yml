  An image isn't source code.  And, apart from that, the images are all png
  files, available under open licenses, and can be modified if someone is
  willing to take the time to do so.


  Granted, having the script to convert a blender object into the eight-by-eight
  png grid would be nice to have, but its not the only way to generate the image
  of a ship.
