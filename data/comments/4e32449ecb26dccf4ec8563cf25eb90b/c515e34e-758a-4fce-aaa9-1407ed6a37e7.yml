message: "Yes, the images.\r\n\r\nGiving users the ability to modify source code and rebuild resulting artefacts is one of the fundamental reasons that the Free Software movement exists in the first place. I think it is a shame that Fedora isn't able to recognise that in this case.\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't accept this situation for programs that couldn't be rebuilt with a newer GCC so why should non-program software be any different?"
