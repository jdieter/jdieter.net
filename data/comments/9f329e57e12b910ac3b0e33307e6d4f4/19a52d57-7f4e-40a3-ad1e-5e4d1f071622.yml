message: "While I do agree with your assessment in theory, you do have to remember that we're in a school in Lebanon where money isn't as plentiful as it is in the West.  The other side of the tradeoff, though, is that some downtime is acceptable.  My boss is pretty understanding when we have problems because of the hardware we use.\r\n\r\nHaving said that, the school has been quite good at getting me the hardware I need when I ask for it.  I just have to be careful about asking for what I need, not what I want.  And, after this experience, managed switches have moved from the \"want\" column to the \"need\" column."
