  Hey David, you've run into a known bug, but one that probably isn't documented
  anywhere.  The problem is that the compose process has changed, and in the
  process, lost the ability to save old deltarpms.  So we generate deltarpms for
  any new packages in the latest compose, but then throw them away when the next
  compose happens.  This means that you'll only ever get deltarpms for the
  latest compose.  :(
