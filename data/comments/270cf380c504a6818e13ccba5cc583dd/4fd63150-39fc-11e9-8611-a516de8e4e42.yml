  It's been going on a while.  I was looking for an email thread that I started
  on the subject, but I can't find it.  I want to say that it's been happening
  for at least a year, but I could be wrong.  And I do feel your pain.  My slow
  internet was the reason I pushed getting deltarpms into Fedora in the first
  place.
