  We greatly appreciate it!  When Tro went in for his visa interview, he said
  they read through the letter and that only thing they questioned about the
  trip was why he was flying into Vienna rather than Prague.  When he explained
  that it was cheaper and closer, they didn't have any other questions for him. 
  Hopefully a good sign; we're still waiting on the visa.
