message: "Thank you very much for working on yum-presto. I loved the feature since the day it was announced, and remember testing it before it was widely available / the default in Fedora. \r\n\r\nBandwidth isn't cheap in many places (Even inside USA), so this plugin was a blessing.\r\n\r\nThe plugin may be gone, but the concept lives on! :D"
