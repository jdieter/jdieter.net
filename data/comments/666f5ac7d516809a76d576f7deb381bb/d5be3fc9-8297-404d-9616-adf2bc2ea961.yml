message: "Hi,\r\n\r\nSorry for being an \"off-topic\" comment, but it is the only way I could found to contact you.\r\nErr... To not be completly \"off-topic\" let me say that I like this fone very much. I've had one in my hands and really loved it. Besides it's price, the only problem I can find withn afone like this is that you really need a gooood data plan...\r\n\r\nSo, Google found your site when, a few days earlier I searched the web for something related with PXE and network booting. I came to your post of PXE and gPXE-(unfortunatly the comments are off). After reading your post, I got the impression that you have very mature implementation and therefore enough knowledge on the subject. I was also curious about \"administrative tool\" that you are using.\r\nCan you please provide me more information about this? Sorry to contact you on this matter this way. Please be free to delete this comment if in any way it offends you.\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nLu√≠s"
