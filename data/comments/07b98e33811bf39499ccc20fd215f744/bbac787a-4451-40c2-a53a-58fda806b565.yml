  You are going to see some load issues with the virtual nature you have set up.
  There is an IO latency of talking to the disks that the nature of the network
  disk services are not going to be very acceptable of and have performance.
  What can happen is that another virtual machine talking to the disks will tie
  up the channel to talk to the spindles and the other virtual machines begin to
  cascade if they are trying to talk to the disks too. The usual ways of dealing
  with this are giving the network disk servers (be it CIFS, NFS, or netware)
  dedicated iocontrollers and disks.
