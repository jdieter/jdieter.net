message: "Are you using kvm + qcow2 images by any chance as virtual machines? If yes, there is your problem. The only way (that I know of right now) to have a performing virtual nfs server is to use lvm volumes as partitions or to use a SAN with raw luns.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, with an old server and fast scsi disks is NFS really fast."
