message: "I've had good experiences with the M4800 and M6800 Dell Precision models. Easy to open up and replace parts, reliable, durable, and while they aren't the newest models, they accept slice batteries while the newer ones don't.\r\n\r\nBest of all, the BIOS can install updates simply by dropping the exe in the EFI system partition, selecting \"Firmware Update\" from the boot menu, and choosing the file in a file picker."
