  You're absolutely right and there are loads of games packaged for Fedora that
  I really enjoy.  There's definitely a difference, though, between most
  open-source games and proprietary games, especially when it comes to having
  the game tell a story.  There are some open-source games that do tell a good
  story (I love Warzone2100), but most games involve jumping in and shooting
  things (think Kobo Deluxe).
