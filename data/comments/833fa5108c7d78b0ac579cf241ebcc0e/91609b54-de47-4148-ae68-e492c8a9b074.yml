message: "Hello Jonathan,\r\n\r\nThanks for sharing your experience on teaching kids the principles of programming.\r\nEven as a teacher, I assume that this is a great/big learning experience (for the teacher) because of the particularities of how computer programs work and the abstraction needed in the first steps.\r\nCan you share how do you plan/organize the classes and what materials do you use?"
