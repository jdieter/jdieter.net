  I tried Fedora 16 Gnome3 for three weeks...Gnome3 surely drives people away
  for its cumbersome and unfriendly interface. Last week I switched to LXDE, I
  was not happy with LXDE either (very buggy and some apps, such as Geany IDE,
  do not work correctly.  LXDE does not work with dual monitors properly)  I
  tried Fedora XFCE and now very happy with it. XFCE allows user to customize
  almost every items on screen - unlike Gnome3 !!! XFCE is fast and small.  Give
  Fedora 16 XFCE a try and you will love it.
