message: "Broadly speaking, you don't. 64-bit code uses more RAM than 32-bit. The difference shouldn't be that big, though; are you sure you ran Firefox and Evo as long 32-bit as you did 64-bit? They tend to just keep creeping up over time.\r\n\r\nThe difference should be about a third (more RAM used by 64-bit), I'm told by those smarter than myself."
