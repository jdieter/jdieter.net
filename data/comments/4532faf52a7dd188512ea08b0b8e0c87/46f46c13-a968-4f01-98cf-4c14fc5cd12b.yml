message: "Alot of people seem to be having this issue as I have seen. Personally 2GB of RAM and 3.06GHz 64bit Dual Core Processor is quite sufficient for me.\r\n\r\nHowever when I am compiling large things I experience heavy swapping. But that is to be expected really. If you decide to go back to 64-bit at any time try flushing your ram on a set time period and see if that helps."
