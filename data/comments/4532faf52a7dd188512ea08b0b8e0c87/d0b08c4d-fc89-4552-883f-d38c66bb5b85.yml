  There does seem to be a memory leak, but it's in mutter, or, more likely, the
  video driver itself (intel).  The thing is, even after leaving it running
  overnight, I still had just under 2GB free and after a killall -9 mutter, was
  back at 2.2GB free.  Under x86_64, after leaving it running overnight, I would
  have 600MB free and it would have already started swapping.  Killall -9 mutter
  would bring it back to 1.2GB free.


  I've heard the same 30% more RAM for x86_64, but I'm consistently seeing
  something more like 100% more RAM for x86_64.  I have no idea why and, while
  I'd like to run x86_64, it's just not worth *that* much RAM.
