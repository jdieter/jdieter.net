  Yes, though I haven't done much with it or Kubernetes since then.  I was
  running into trouble with the CRS models.  They had configuration options that
  supposedly allowed them to be configured as a load balancer, but I never
  managed to get them working.  We then swapped in an RB3011, and it did work
  correctly.
