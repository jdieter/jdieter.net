message: "A perennial plant growing 1 to 2 feet high, sage produces small, grey-green and deeply veined leaves, with the intensity of the flavor growing stronger as the plant ages. 3 Sage comes in various forms: Russian sage is known for its lavender-purple flowers and ornamental applications, while the common sage is regarded for its pungent aroma that is widely used in cooking. 4  \r\n<a href=http://fluffycat.ga/art/black-fluffy-cat-breeds/>Black fluffy cat breeds</a>"
