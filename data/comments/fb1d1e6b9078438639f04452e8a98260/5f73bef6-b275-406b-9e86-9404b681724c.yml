  I've been using TP-Link access points at a school exclusively for a few years,
  of course reflashed with OpenWRT.  I've mostly used the WR1043ND, but also a
  few WDR4300 which are nice because they add 5GHz support.  I'm curious what
  custom changes you've made as the default build has worked great for me.
