  The main changes are having the configuration hard-coded in the image and the
  addition of some scripts to switch the wireless SSID to an emergency mode when
  it can't ping our DHCP server.  This prevents users from trying to (and
  failing) to connect when an AP's cabling has been cut or a UPS for an
  intermediate switch hasn't survived our daily power cuts.
