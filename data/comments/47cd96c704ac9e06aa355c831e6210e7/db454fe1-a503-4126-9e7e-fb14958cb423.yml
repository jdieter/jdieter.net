  I have an old 3 years old HP Probook, and I was also surprised - also I had
  some overheating problems, and took my HP to one of these CIS / HP Partner
  here at HU too. 3 days later my fan was replaced, I have received an list what
  they have checked (what they found also), and some suggestions that my battery
  also possibly needs to be replaced if I want. I said yes, another 3 days, and
  I have received my notebook CLEANED, with replaced battery, and CPU fan. No
  worries, no hiccups, no extra random fees, just the fine work, and my laptop
  were repaired. Applause, and thanks....
