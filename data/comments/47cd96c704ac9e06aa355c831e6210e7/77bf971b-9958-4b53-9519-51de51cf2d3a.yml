message: "I have a very old dual-core AMD HP/Compaq V6000 laptop, circa 2007 or 2008 I think. There was an issue with the main board and HP repaired it at their local service agent in two days under warranty with no hassles. Later, in 2009 when the warranty period was out, the main board failed again. \"Oh no\", I thought, \"This is going to be bad\". But I called the local 1800 number and actually spoke to a technical person who was able to advise me how to drive their spare parts web site to obtain, not only a replacement main board, but also to activate the buy-back for the failed one. The replacement main board arrived, I repaired the laptop using the online service manuals (I have 15 years of electronics industry experience so maybe this isn't the road for everyone to travel), and sent the failed main board off to obtain the purchase buy-back discount. I was very happy. It wasn't cheap but it was a lot cheaper than replacing the laptop or having the service agent repair it considering the specs at the time were very good. Not a case of international support but a very positive experience with HP support. I noticed the replacement main board had a higher revision number and no problems have occurred since. I still use the laptop day to day as my main development machine even though the specs are surpassed these days. I've just bought a new 12-cell battery for it and intend to keep using it for a while yet. \r\n\r\nFC16, Apache, mySQL, PHP, VirtualBox, Eclipse etc, etc"
