  It's hard to say what might have happened without a lot more information,
  which I'll assume was in your bug report and is being examined by others, but
  I am curious about one thing.  Usually when GlusterFS is used to replace DRBD
  it's used with replication enabled, but you don't mention replication.  Both
  your performance results and your rebalance failure also seem more consistent
  with a non-replicated setup.  Am I correct in concluding that you were not
  using GlusterFS replication?
