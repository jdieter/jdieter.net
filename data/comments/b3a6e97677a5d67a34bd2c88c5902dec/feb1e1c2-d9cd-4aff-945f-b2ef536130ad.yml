  First off, my apologies, but I haven't created a bug report.  We were at a
  point where we needed the system up ASAP, and I didn't expect there'd be much
  value for you in a bug report without having a live system to test fixes on.


  We did have GlusterFS set up, originally with two pairs of 2TB drives and then
  expanded it to four pairs of 2TB drives.  It was during the migrate-data stage
  of the rebalance that one of the servers died and was then restarted, and
  that's when we started losing data across both replicated drives.


  I do still have the logs, so if you think it's worth it for me to open a bug
  report, I'll happily do so.  I just won't be able to test any fixes.
