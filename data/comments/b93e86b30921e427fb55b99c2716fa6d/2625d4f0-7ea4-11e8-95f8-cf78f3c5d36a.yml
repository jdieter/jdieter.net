  The chunks do not have a fixed size, but can either be manually ended if you
  have a format that has natural chunking locations (when chunking the Fedora
  repository metadata, we create a new chunk after writing each "package" tag),
  or automatically using the buzhash algorithm.  Buzhash basically checks
  whether a checksum of the last n bytes matches a number, and, if it does, ends
  the chunk.  Adding and removing bytes will only affect the one chunk that was
  changed.
