  Jonathan: Do the chunks have fixed size? If not, is there some sort of "diff"
  functionality that can be used to align chunk boundaries between a previous
  and a new version of a file, so that the minimal number of chunks are changed
  if bytes are inserted or removed somewhere in the middle of the uncompressed
  file?
