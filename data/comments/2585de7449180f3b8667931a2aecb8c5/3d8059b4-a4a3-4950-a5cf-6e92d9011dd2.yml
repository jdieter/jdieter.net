message: "I had been trying to get novacom running to access my Pre 3, to no avail.\r\n\r\nThen I read your previous blog post, rebuilt the srpms from the review, installed the result, and everything worked.\r\n\r\nYesterday when updating my laptop, I saw the latest novacom coming from the repositories, replacing the ones I had rebuilt myself.\r\n\r\nSounds like a win to me. Thank you. :)"
