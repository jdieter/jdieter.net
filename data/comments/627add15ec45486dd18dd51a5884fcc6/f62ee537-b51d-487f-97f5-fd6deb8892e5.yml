  You're absolutely right, and I actually did heavily modify the wondershaper
  script to class traffic according to its mark and then used iptables to direct
  traffic.  The problem is that /etc/sysconfig/iptables ended up being an opaque
  mess and I struggled to work out what classes went where and why.  PfSense's
  web interface is easy to follow, and the ability to do aliases makes my rules
  far more self-documenting.
