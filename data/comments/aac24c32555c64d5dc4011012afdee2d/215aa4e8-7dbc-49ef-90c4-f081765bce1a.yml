  I'm using the open drivers.  I'm not a fan of the closed drivers as they've
  proven to be pretty buggy.  I think Fedora 19 has UVD support, so you should
  be able to use hardware-enabled decoding using the open drivers.  I've also
  been playing around with mesa-10.0 and it has very buggy OpenCL support with
  the open drivers.
