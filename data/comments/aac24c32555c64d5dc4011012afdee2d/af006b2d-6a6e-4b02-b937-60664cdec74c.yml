  Curious if you are using the open source driver for those cards or the
  proprietary. I am currently using F17 with a hacked version of systemd to
  support the proprietary drivers (my project requires hardware enabled
  decoding) and was curious if the latest version of systemd no longer require
  modifying the source?
