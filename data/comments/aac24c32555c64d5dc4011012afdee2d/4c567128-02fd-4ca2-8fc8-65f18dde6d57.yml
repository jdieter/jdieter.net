  Any recent (F19-F21) Fedora release should offer something close to an
  out-of-the-box experience with the Plugable Docks, assuming they're supported
  by a modern Linux kernel.  I would suggest installing Fedora 21 on the
  computer, plugging in the docks, and then plugging in monitors, keyboards and
  mice into the docks.  If the docks are supported, new login screens should
  appear on each monitor.
