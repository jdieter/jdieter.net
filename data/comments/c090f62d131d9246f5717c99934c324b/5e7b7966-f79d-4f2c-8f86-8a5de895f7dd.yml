message: "Android dev really is a whole different world, and very hard to figure out just by looking at git. You really want to get on the XDA forum for your device and poke some of the experienced devs there, if there are any, and see if they can guide you. If no-one's done anything on the Veer, try and find a friendly dev for a similar device.\r\n\r\nI know there are some moves within CM and AOKP to try and reduce the silo and fork problem; for instance, I know CM is working towards a 'unified' build for all the devices that use the particular MSM variant in my phone. But this isn't just a third-party problem, it's how things are being done by the first parties. The phone manufacturers usually do release the source for their kernel modifications, eventually, and that's what the third party projects work from; but each device is inevitably given a separate code dump, there is absolutely no co-operation between manufacturers or even co-ordination by manufacturers between their different phones. It's not like Samsung has a public git repo for their kernel stuff where they have the source for all their devices with minimal branching, or anything like that: they just toss a tarball over the wall for each device, every so often, and that's what you get. Like I said, different world."
