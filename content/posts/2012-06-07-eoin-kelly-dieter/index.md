At 12:30PM on June 5, 2012, Eoin (pronounced the same as &#8220;Owen&#8221; for those who unreasonably expect the Irish spelling to have some relationship to how the name is pronounced) Kelly Dieter was born. He&#8217;s 7 lbs, 12 oz (3.53 kg).

Naomi made this delivery look like a piece of cake (again), and Eoin went a full six hours between feeds last night, so we&#8217;re hoping that he&#8217;ll do as well as his sisters did at sleeping through the night.

Saoirse and Ailíse are very excited that they have a little brother, though it&#8217;s taken a bit of work to convince Ailíse that Eoin shouldn&#8217;t be treated like a doll.

In the meantime, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be very productive over the next few weeks.
