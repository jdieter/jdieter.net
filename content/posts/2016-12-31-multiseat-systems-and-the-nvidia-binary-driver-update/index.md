Last month I wrote about [using the NVIDIA binary driver with multiseat systems][2]. There were a number of crazy tweaks that we had to use to make it work, but with some recent updates, the most egregious are no longer necessary. Hans de Goede [posted about an Xorg update][3] that removes the requirement for a separate Xorg configuration folder for the NVIDIA card, and I&#8217;ve created [a pull request][4] for negativo17.org&#8217;s NVIDIA driver that uses the updated Xorg configs in a way that&#8217;s friendly to multiseat systems.

To make it Just Workâ„¢, all you should need is [xorg-x11-server-1.19.0-3.fc25][5] from F25 updates-testing, my [mesa build][6] ([source here][7], Fedora&#8217;s mesa rebuilt with libglvnd enabled), my [NVIDIA driver build][8] ([source here][9]), and the [negativo17.org nvidia repository][10] enabled.

With the above packages, Xorg should use the correct driver automagically with whatever video card you have.
