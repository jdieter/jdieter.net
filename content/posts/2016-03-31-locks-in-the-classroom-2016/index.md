For [the fourth year][1] now, our grade nine students have been doing 3D modeling using [Blender][2]. A couple of weeks ago, our students finished up their first assignments, and I gave the top modelers the option of showing off their work. This year one of my students came in already an expert at 3D modeling (far, far better than I am), so he&#8217;s been inspiring other students to go above what I&#8217;ve seen in previous years. Without further ado, here are the top models from each of the three grade nine classes (click on the pictures for Full HD renders).

{{< imgproc "barbour" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by Barbour &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> &#8211; <a href="http://lesloueizeh.com/jdieter/3D/2015-2016/1/barbour.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

Nice use of materials, with a colorful choice for a background image.

Very creative and very different than most of the others. I love the key.

I normally don&#8217;t teach animation until the end of the year, but Yubin didn&#8217;t want to wait and came up with this. Very nice!

{{< imgproc "carmouna" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by Carmouna &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a> &#8211; <a href="http://lesloueizeh.com/jdieter/3D/2015-2016/1/carmouna.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

The artistic eye used to compose this scene makes this project really stand out.

{{< imgproc "nahuda" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by Nahuda &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a> &#8211; <a href="http://lesloueizeh.com/jdieter/3D/2015-2016/1/nahuda.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

I love the double lock thing going on here.

{{< imgproc "rayray" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by RayRay &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a> &#8211; <a href="http://lesloueizeh.com/jdieter/3D/2015-2016/1/rayray.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

The chain just makes this look cool.

{{< imgproc "annan" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by Annan &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a> &#8211; <a href="http://lesloueizeh.com/jdieter/3D/2015-2016/1/annan.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

And wow! Annan used the game physics in Blender to get this chain to rest on the table. This looks great!

{{< imgproc "mohammad" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by Mohammad &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> &#8211; <a href="http://lesloueizeh.com/jdieter/3D/2015-2016/1/mohammad.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

The final render looks good, but you need to download and open the [source][13] to really appreciate this scene. We&#8217;re seeing the front of a classroom from inside a locker, with the lock hanging on the door. Mohammad designed the entire classroom and it looks great (and incidentally, looks like most of the classes in the school).

{{< imgproc "jharake" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by JHarake &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/">CC0</a> &#8211; <a href="http://lesloueizeh.com/jdieter/3D/2015-2016/1/jharake.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

When I first looked at this, I thought JHarake had found a great background image. Then I realized that he didn&#8217;t use a background image. This is a complete 3D scene, created by a student who makes his teacher&#8217;s most intricate Blender projects look like the scribblings of a small child. Well done JHarake!
