Last year I started teaching programming to my grade 10 classes. I started with [Python][2], which is easy to understand, forces good programming practices, and is one of my favorite languages. It was a complete disaster. I had four or five in each class who understood what I was doing, and the rest were completely lost, which says a whole lot about my teaching. At [DevConf.cz][3] 2014, I chatted with [Matthew Miller][4] about my Python problem, and he suggested teaching my students [Scratch][5].

For those (like me) that don&#8217;t know about it, Scratch is a graphical programming language that&#8217;s designed to be easy to use while still allowing the full power of a proper programming language. The benefit of teaching programming using Scratch is that the students get quick graphical feedback on what works and what doesn&#8217;t, and syntax errors are pretty much impossible. Once they understand the basic concepts of programming, it&#8217;s then easier to switch to something like Python.

I switched to Scratch, and the students loved it. (Or, at the very least, liked it better than Python.) I ended the school year with a group assignment that was partially graded based on votes by the rest of the classes. I had great ideas for making the group assignments available online, but never went anywhere with it. Fast-forward to this year where we&#8217;ve started with Scratch and are now almost done with it and ready to move on to Python. And, since I now have a deadline, I&#8217;ve put together a simple site so they can vote on each others&#8217; group projects.

At the moment, it has last year&#8217;s projects and is open for anyone to rate, so if you want to try out their projects, go to <https://scratch.lesbg.com>, give them a shot, and rate them. This was a first attempt for both students and myself, so please be gentle on the ratings.

Sometime in the next few weeks I&#8217;ll post this year&#8217;s projects. They will be available to play, but initially only students or teachers in the school will be able to rate them. Once I&#8217;ve scored them, I&#8217;ll open up the ratings to everybody.

If you have any comments or suggestions for the site itself, please leave them below.
