As I [mentioned last year][2], programming is on the syllabus for our grade 10 students, and they have just finished this year&#8217;s group projects in Scratch. We&#8217;re moving on to python, but I&#8217;ve posted their projects at <http://scratch.lesbg.com> Feel free to play them and rate them. This is a first attempt for students, so do please be gentle on the ratings.

If you want to check out previous years&#8217; projects, they&#8217;re also available at the links at the top left. If you have any comments or suggestions for the site itself, please leave them below.
