In my [last post][2], I mentioned that I had patched [Novacom][3] to work in Fedora and was packaging it. Thanks to Mohamed El Morabity&#8217;s review, Novacom is now in Fedora 15+ as well as EPEL 5/6.

So if you&#8217;re running Fedora or RHEL with EPEL enabled, installing novacom is as easy as:
  
`yum install novacom`
