For [the fifth year][1] now, our grade nine students have been doing 3D modeling using [Blender][2]. Our students finished up their first assignments over a month ago, but it&#8217;s taken this long for me to get the top models together. So, with no further delay, here are the top models from each of the three grade nine classes (click on the pictures for Full HD renders).

We start with this nice mix of color and reflection.
{{< imgproc "abadr" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by A. Badr &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.lesbg.com/jdieter/3D/2016-2017/1/abadr.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

Next is a double-lock combination.

And I love the addition of a key in this lock.

Next is the missing link. I really like the mix of pink and black.
{{< imgproc "fromdawn02" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by fromdawn02 &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.lesbg.com/jdieter/3D/2016-2017/1/fromdawn02.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

Here we have safari-themed locks. Nice choice of textures!
{{< imgproc "aayvazian1" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by A. Ayvazian &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.lesbg.com/jdieter/3D/2016-2017/1/aayvazian1.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

And here&#8217;s a lock in a cave. The cave itself is a proper model, not just a background image.
{{< imgproc "azamroud" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by A. Zamroud &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.lesbg.com/jdieter/3D/2016-2017/1/azamroud.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

Here we have the lock on the Pearly Gates. I would have loved for the lock texture to be of better quality, but I really appreciate how @david190 has shaped the lock to match the texture, especially on the top.
{{< imgproc "davidk190" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by @david190 &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.lesbg.com/jdieter/3D/2016-2017/1/davidk190.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

And here we have a beautiful lock in a velvety box. Very nice!
{{< imgproc "waadh" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by Waad H. &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.lesbg.com/jdieter/3D/2016-2017/1/waadh.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

We can&#8217;t have a lock assignment without the obligatory pirate&#8217;s treasure chest. I love the attention to detail!
{{< imgproc "sarahb" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by Sarah B. &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.lesbg.com/jdieter/3D/2016-2017/1/sarahb.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}

And, our final submission includes a monkey. Because&#8230; monkeys rock? What a wonderful level of detail in this scene.
{{< imgproc "jpkazzi" Resize "625x" none >}}Lock by JP Kazzi &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA</a> &#8211; <a href="https://www.lesbg.com/jdieter/3D/2016-2017/1/jpkazzi.blend">Source</a>{{< /imgproc >}}
