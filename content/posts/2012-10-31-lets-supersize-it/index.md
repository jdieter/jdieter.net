Seven or eight years ago, I set up a small computer system to play music on. A little under four years ago I upgraded it to a media center by adding a 22&#8243; 1920&#215;1080 monitor and installing XBMC on the computer. And today, to treat myself for my 29th (with three years experience) birthday, I&#8217;ve finally upgraded to a proper 39&#8243; 1080p LED TV.

XBMC looks just as good on a large screen, and _Avatar_ in HD is just gorgeous. The only down side is that now it&#8217;s a lot easier to see how bad my photography skills are when our pictures cycle through as the screensaver.

Now if I could just work out how to set up full screen anti-aliasing in XBMC using AMD&#8217;s open source drivers&#8230;
