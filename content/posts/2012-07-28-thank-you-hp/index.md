Last September, while I was on sabbatical in the States, I bought an HP laptop (along with my HP tablet and HP phone). I ordered it online and specced it to have a full HD display and a Radeon video card in addition to the built-in Intel video, and was very happy with it.

The one complaint I had was that the fan started making noise after four or five months (at which point I was back in Lebanon). I tried disassembling the laptop to clean the fan, and it didn&#8217;t fix the problem. So I just let it go, and, eventually, the noisy fan got quieter.

A few weeks ago, I noticed that my laptop was running visibly slower than usual, and I rebooted. As came back up, I got a warning from the BIOS saying that the fan was no longer working correctly. I put my hand next to the fan outlet, and there was almost no air movement. The fan wasn&#8217;t completely dead, but it sure wasn&#8217;t working the way it should. When Fedora finished booting, it was running slow again. I checked the sensors, and, sure enough, it was running hot. Very hot. Obviously the fan needed to be replaced.

I checked the warranty status on my laptop, and found, to my surprise, that, even though I bought it in the US, it was covered with a world-wide warranty. Supposedly I could take my laptop anywhere in the world and have it repaired for free.

Now, I&#8217;ve lived in Lebanon for many years, and found that &#8216;customer service&#8217; here normally consists of waving goodbye as you walk away with your new purchase. And a warranty is worth its weight in gold&#8230; until you leave the shop. Then it no longer applies, because, obviously, warranties aren&#8217;t intended to protect you once you&#8217;ve started using the product. This applies to the bigger international companies as well as the smaller mom-and-pop shops. I remember asking the local official Skoda dealer about a warranty on a used car and he told me, &#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a verbal warranty.&#8221; For some reason, I was less than impressed.

I contacted HP in Lebanon and they directed me to one of the HP authorized repair centers called Computer Information Systems (CIS). I took my laptop in last Friday and fully expected to be told that, for some obscure reason, the fan wasn&#8217;t going to be covered under warranty. Instead, they took my laptop without any hassle at all.

On Tuesday (two working days later!), I got a call from CIS telling me that it was ready. I went back in and got my laptop back, again with no hassle at all. They did tell me that I was in luck that they had the part because it was a US model, but they would have ordered the part if they hadn&#8217;t had it in stock.

So, while I&#8217;m not impressed that the system fan died so quickly, I&#8217;m _very_ impressed that HP automatically gave me a worldwide warranty and I&#8217;m _astounded_ that CIS did the work quickly without trying to find some way to charge me. Thank you both for your professionalism!
