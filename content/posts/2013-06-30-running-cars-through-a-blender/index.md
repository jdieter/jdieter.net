For their final Blender assignment, my grade nine students were asked to make an object (in most cases a car) go around some kind of track that followed the contour of the ground. These are some of the more creative projects that I received. Please note that in some cases the source doesn&#8217;t perfectly match the video. For some there were extenuating circumstances, and the others had it reflected in their scores.

_I like the solid feel that this scene has, despite the glitches in the terrain texture mapping. I did keep expecting the truck to transform._

_I&#8217;m not completely sure, but I think I would really enjoy driving this car._

_I&#8217;m not sure if the camera angle really does it justice, but this scene has a really nice switchback. The car, the road and the terrain are all nicely modelled and textured, a rare combination._

_This was the only project where the car had headlights that actually project light. Very nice._

_While not technically brilliant, the creativity and sheer strangeness of this scene made it impossible to exclude._

_I love the creative use of white balls for clouds and the covered wagon was icing on the cake._

_The car bouncing around the track is pure vanilla, but the end is pretty impressive. It brought to mind the end of a [movie][9] that I saw as a kid._
