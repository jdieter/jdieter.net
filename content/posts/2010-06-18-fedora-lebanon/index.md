[<img src="http://cedarandthistle.files.wordpress.com/2010/06/letter.jpg?w=200" alt="Handwritten letter" title="letter" width="200" height="300" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-192" srcset="/images/2010/06/letter.jpg 683w, /images/2010/06/letter-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px" />][1]One of my friends is an Ubuntu user, and recently introduced me to the [Ubuntu Lebanon mailing list][2]. Now I haven&#8217;t subscribed, but the archives were sure interesting, and I had to ask myself, &#8220;Why don&#8217;t we have something like that for Fedora?&#8221;

So we now have the [Fedora Lebanon users mailing list][3] along with the [#fedora-lb][4] chat room on Freenode.

There&#8217;s also [a page on the wiki][5] that is supposed to serve as a starting page for Fedora Lebanon, but it may be moved.

If you live in Lebanon or if you are Lebanese (or if you wish you were Lebanese), please subscribe to the mailing list and join me in the chat room.
