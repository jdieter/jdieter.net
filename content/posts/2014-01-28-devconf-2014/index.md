Thanks to some help from [the school][2], Tro Chakerian (one of my assistants) and I will be going to Brno, Czech Republic for [DevConf][3] 2014. I&#8217;m really looking forward to getting to meet some other Fedora developers, and I&#8217;m hoping to learn a few things that will advance our school&#8217;s system over the next year or so.

I&#8217;m particularly looking forward to [Why use a SAT solver for package management?][4], [DNF API][5] and [Fedora.next: Future of Fedora Big Picture][6]. The last one is probably the most important for us as a school as we plan to continue to use Fedora on the desktop for the foreseeable future.
