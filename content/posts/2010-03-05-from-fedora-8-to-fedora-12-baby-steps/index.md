Yesterday, I realized that I hadn&#8217;t upgraded the server that runs <http://lesloueizeh.com> for a _long_ time. It was still running Fedora 8, which has obviously been without updates for a while. So in between my other work today, I did a step-by-step upgrade from Fedora 8 to Fedora 12.

The problem is that the server is located in the States somewhere, I&#8217;m located in Beirut, and the only access I have to it is via ssh. If I screw something up badly enough that the server won&#8217;t boot, I can&#8217;t just go to runlevel 1 to fix it.

[This page][2] was a great help! It took a number of hours (mainly because of delays on my side), but I finally got there this afternoon. Yay for Yum upgrades!
