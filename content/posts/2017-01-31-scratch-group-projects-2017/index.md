It&#8217;s January, so it must be time for this year&#8217;s Scratch projects from my grade 10 students. We&#8217;re moving on to python, but I&#8217;ve posted their projects at <http://scratch.lesbg.com> Feel free to play them and rate them. This is a first attempt for students, so do please be gentle on the ratings.

One of my personal favorites is [Gravity Clash][2], which is strangely addicting, given how simple it is.

If you want to check out previous years&#8217; projects, they&#8217;re also available at the links at the top left. If you have any comments or suggestions for the site itself, please leave them below.
