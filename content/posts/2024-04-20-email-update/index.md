This is just a quick update that I'm updating my primary email address.  A year or so ago, I bought the domain `dieter.ie` (since I'm resident in Ireland, it seemed like a good choice), and it seemed time to put it to good use.  My blog will continue to be hosted on [jdieter.net](https://www.jdieter.net), but my primary email address is now [jonathan@dieter.ie](mailto:jonathan@dieter.ie).  My previous Gmail address will continue to work and I'm not giving it up any time soon.

I'm also very aware that it's been a while since I last posted.  The company I work for, Spearline, was acquired just over a year ago by [Cyara](https://cyara.com), and life has been unusually hectic over the last year.  Hopefully I'll have some time to post a bit more frequently in the near future.  In the meantime, I've included a picture I took yesterday of an old ringfort nearby.  West Cork is beautiful when the weather's nice!
