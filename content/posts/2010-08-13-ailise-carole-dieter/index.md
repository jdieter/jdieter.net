At 10:25PM on August 12, 2010, Ailíse (pronounced &#8220;a-lee-shuh&#8221; for those not conversant in the tangled labyrinth that is Irish spelling) Carole Dieter was born. She&#8217;s 8 lbs, 6 oz (that&#8217;s 3.8 kilos for those conservative reactionaries like my wife who don&#8217;t want to move to the new Imperial system), 20 in (50 cm), and absolutely gorgeous (and I&#8217;ll challenge anyone who disagrees to a duel, popsicle sticks at 10 paces).

Her older sister, Saoirse, is ecstatic (ok, she has no clue what&#8217;s going on, but hey, she&#8217;s only a year and a half old), and my wife, Naomi, is excited (or is that exhausted, it&#8217;s kind of hard to tell as she lies crashed out on the couch).

As for me, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be getting much work done over the next couple of weeks.
