The presto test repositories for Fedora at <http://lesloueizeh.com> have been removed. They were only available for Fedora Core 6 &#8211; Fedora 10, which have all been EOL&#8217;d.

The official Fedora repositories have been carrying deltarpms since Fedora 11, so there was no longer any reason to keep the test repositories around.

The [CentOS 5 presto repositories][2] are still available and will be until the CentOS project enables deltarpms for their repositories (if they ever do).
