Once again, it&#8217;s time for this year&#8217;s Scratch projects from my grade 10 students. Up next is python, but their final projects are available at <https://scratch.lesbg.com>. Feel free to play them and rate them. This is a first attempt for students, so do please be gentle on the ratings.

If you&#8217;re into nice mini-games, one of my favorites from this year is [Arcade][1], which includes Duck Hunt on steroids!

If you want to check out previous years&#8217; projects, they&#8217;re also available at the links at the top left. If you have any comments or suggestions for the site itself, please leave them below.
