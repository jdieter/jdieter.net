At 7:45AM on April 14, 2014, Cillian (KILL-ee-an) James Dieter was born. He was 9 lbs, 4 oz (4.2 kg).

This was a very quick delivery, and I was still able to be at a class trip that started two hours after he was born. Easter break started two days after he was born, and Naomi&#8217;s parents are here now to spend some time with us all, so life has been pretty relaxed for the last week and a half.

Saoirse, Ailíse and Eoin are very excited that they have a little brother, but I think it will take Eoin a little while to grasp that he&#8217;s no longer the baby in the family.
