[InstallQuest 2011][2] is only four days away! The idea of the InstallQuest is to mix installing Linux on participant&#8217;s computers with short lessons on how to use their new desktops.

We have three members of the local Fedora community involved, along with a few members from other local Linux communities. A number of my students have been asking for Fedora, so hopefully this will be an opportunity for them to get it.
