So I&#8217;m sitting here in Kraków, doing some last-minute preparation for my talk ([Fedora in the Classroom][2]) at the upcoming Flock conference next week.

I&#8217;ll be looking at why we use Fedora in our school, what tools we use to setup and maintain our workstations, and the actual subjects that we teach our students, complete with actual projects[<sup>1</sup>][3] that our students have done.

If you&#8217;re a teacher looking for ways to use open source software in the classroom, an administrator looking for a computer curriculum that emphasizes creativity and comprehension over memorization and rote learning, or you&#8217;re just interested in seeing how Fedora is effectively used in a school environment, please do come check it out.
